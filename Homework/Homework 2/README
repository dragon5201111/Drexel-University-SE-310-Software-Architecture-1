Using Sample Files:
Sample Files are located in the 'Homework 2/resources/sampleFiles' directory. To use the sample files, run the java program for the first time and select
"Load" from the menu. This will create a directory 'ser' in the appropriate location relative to your machine.
Then quit the program and drag the sample files in the sampleFiles directory into the
newly created 'ser' directory. Look for the most recently created 'ser' directory.
This is the best work-around I could create regarding path issues regarding different machines.

What works:
Everything works as desired. All functionality is implemented. The only difference between my solution and the solution provided in the
instructions is some output formatting in the Tabulation and Displaying With Correct Answers functionality.

Development & Testing:
Developed on SDK 11, Language Level SDK Default.
This application was built and tested on Windows and was briefly tested on Drexel's Linux Cluster - TUX
(Linux tux1 5.15.0-134-generic #145-Ubuntu SMP Wed Feb 12 20:08:39 UTC 2025 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux).

IMPORTANT INFO:
Regarding the menus, I added extra prompts to improve the overall program control. These prompts are in ADDITION to all of the other
menu requirements and are for quality of life; all required menus are present.

Running The Program:
Compile Main.java in 'Homework 2/src' and run.

Command Line:
~Change current working directory to 'Homework 2/src'~
javac Main.java
java Main
